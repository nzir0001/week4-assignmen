            <p><em>I swam because swimming is an activity that interests me enormously.If I really want to flourish during the day, I absolutely have to dive into the water to find freshness, I like being in the water</em></p>
            <p>I also like to watch <abbr title="television">TV</abbr> because for me it is the only way to get away from my worries, I also like to take a little nap from time to time, because resting allows me to stimulate my brain and find my senses. mind</p>
